## Hi there, I'm Alex! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based out of Sydney Australia. I love full stack development, and seeing something start from data design all the way to hitting the screen in a beautiful UI component. I'm a simple man with simple tastesâ€”give me TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Express, and Iâ€™ll build you the world (or at least a solid web app). Don't get me wrong though, I'll dabble elsewhere if I ever need to.

I work at [XMB Technology](https://www.xmb.com.au/), which is a company I co-founded with some friends of mine. We just like to build things, and build them well. We are currently working on building [RTOPilot](http://rtopilot.com.au/), to help simplify things for Registered Training Organisations in Australia!
